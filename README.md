## About Me
I'm a statistics and computer science (hopefully - since applications are a thing) major at UNC.

Why? For stat, that's an easy question - I really like being able to (in a way) see the future.
For CS, it's more because my first impression of software development - being a part of my high school's robotics team - was a very positive one.

As such, one of my primary interests is robotics and control theory. There's just nothing quite as satisfying as your code finally making the hunk of metal in front of you move (and also nothing quite as terrifying as it violently flailing it's arm up and down when you've picked terrible pre-tuning control constants).

I also really enjoyed competitive math in the past years, I'm swapping that over to competitive programming now in college, so we'll see how that goes (but it's been fun so far). 

I'm currently learning the basics of web development, as that's a large sphere of software development that I've never touched until recently. I'm definitely pleasantly surprised at the simplicity of a lot of these frameworks, as it makes it quite easy to turn my ideas into reality.

Additionally, I've done a little work on in the past on reinforcement learning, mostly because I though that it would be dominant at playing cards - which it was very much not. It is definitely something I want learning more about in the future, along with machine learning in general, really.

In terms of other hobbies, I really enjoy practicing the piano (although I'm truthfully not very good) and - as hinted above - playing cards with friends and family.
